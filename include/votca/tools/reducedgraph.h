/**
 * \brief Contains a graph that consits of vertices with degree of 1 or greater than 3
 *
 * The point of this class is to reduce the computational complexity of a
 * regular graph. This is achieved by removing any vertices with degree 2. For 
 * example a graph:
 *
 * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 9
 *     |   |   |
 *     6 - 7   8
 *
 * Would be reduced to 
 *
 * 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 9
 *     | _ |   |
 *             8
 *
 * Notice that the vertices 5, 6 and 7 have been removed, there also exist two
 * edges connecting 2 to 3.
