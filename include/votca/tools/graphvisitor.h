/**
 * \brief A graph visitor class for creating graph visitor objects
 *
 * This class serves as the base class for creating graph visitor objects
 * it contains the framework by which all derived graph visitors should follow.
 * The function of the graph visitor is to explore a graph, this can be done in
 * different ways such as a breadth first or depth first algorithm or others.
 *
 * The general flow of the class is as follows:
 * 
 * 1. Set the node the graph visitor will start on and create an edge queue
 * 2. Get an edge from the edge queue
 * 3. Explore the edge and operate on the unexplored node(optional) add more
 * edges to the edge queue.
 * 4. Repeat until no more edges exist in the queue.
