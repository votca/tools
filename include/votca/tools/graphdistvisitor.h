/**
 * \brief A graph visitor determines the graph topology
 *
 * This visitor will calculate the distance of each node from the starting node
 * it is built on top of the graph breadth first visitor. As the visitor moves
 * through the graph it adds a 'Dist' attribute to each graph node with an
 * integer value corresponding to how far it is removed from the starting node.
 *
 * E.g.
 *
 * 0 - 1 - 2 - 3
 *
 * If vertex 1 is the starting vertex than the graph node associated with
 * vertex 1 will have a distance of 0. Vertices 0 and 2 a distance of 1 and
 * vertex 3 a distnace of 2.
